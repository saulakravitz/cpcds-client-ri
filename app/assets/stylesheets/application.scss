 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other 
 * CSS/SCSS files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* 
 * statement. It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
